# MVVM Starter Kit

We present a framework to help you get started separating user interface from code using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.

It depends on the [Grijjy Foundation](https://github.com/grijjy/GrijjyFoundation) repository. Make sure that GrijjyFoundation is in your library path (or otherwise at the same directory level as MvvmStarterKit).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is with the following three blog posts. They provide an introduction to the MVVM pattern but also serve as a sort of programming guide:

* [MVVM Starter Kit (Part 1 of 3)](https://blog.grijjy.com/2018/01/22/mvvm-starter-kit-part-1-of-3/): introduces the MVVM pattern, presents a data binding framework, and talks about buildig the Models for a sample application.
* MVVM Starter Kit (Part 2 of 3): focuses on ViewModels and how they can be unit tested.
* MVVM Starter Kit (Part 3 of 3): ties everything together by looking at Views and how to bind them to ViewModels. Shows how you can build both a VCL and FMX version of the same application with a minimum amount of framework-specific code.
